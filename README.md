Description

The European Master in Project Management (EuroMPM) is a study programme implemented at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Dortmund and embedded in the consortium of European universities with the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao (Spain), the NTNU in Trondheim (Norway), the Kiev National University of Construction and Architecture in Kiev (Ukraine) and the Kauno Technologijos Universitetas in Kaunas (Lithuania).
The development of competences in international project management is the core focus of the EuroMPM - with core modules in the first 2 semesters, a specialization in the 3rd semester, and a master thesis in the 4th semester (in total 120 ECTS). The course leads students to the Ph.D. entry point by granting a Master of Arts (M.A.) degree.
The curriculum is based upon international standards that are important for project management (IPMA, PMI, OGC, ISO, etc.) and is completely taught in English.
